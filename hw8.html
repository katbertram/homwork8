        1. The backend is how the site is able to do everything the user doesnâ€™t see on their screens, such as updates, security, and changes of the webpage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMtgFZSdtwk I like this source because it was a video and therefore their
        were pictures along with a voice over with simplistic explanations of the fundamentals of servers. http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/54145/i-dont-really-understand-backend-serverside-when-it-comes-to-web-development I like
        this resource because it has multiple users answering questions and therefore you can read through various different explanations to better understand what servers are and how to use them. https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/back-end-web-developer/
        This resource gives a very in depth description along with suggesting other pageswith similar topics that could increase your understanding of different severs.</p1><br/>

        2.SQl stands for Structured Query Language and is used to communicate with a database; it is used to preform tasks such as updates and retrieving data from the database When doing data scaling SQL is the better way to go, whereas during performance scaling
        NoSQL is the better sever to use. SQL is usually used by smaller websites where as large scale websites like facebook and Google use NoSQL https://blog.udemy.com/beginners-guide-to-sql/ https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sql-tutorial-introduction#sm.00000kxs782qbjdnyzh41b849axdy</p2><br/>

        3. http://jamesknelson.com/grokking-es6-promises-the-four-functions-you-need-to-avoid-callback-hell/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise On these two websites I learned that a promise is a proxy for a
        value created for use now or in the future, therefore you might not always know the promises value yet. Essentially it promises to eventually give the server something but at the moment it is unable to service a request. The promise is either
        in a state of pending, fulfilled or rejected. http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2015/02/promises/ From this website I learned that promises are a way to work with callbacks and serves as a placeholder for the final result. </p3><br/>

        4. These a thee unique resources I found to help with git merge problems https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-9NGrpU-c https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge http://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git visual studios will
        be launched when editing mergers. To edit save and exit just "git check out master" "git pull" "git merge test" and then "git push" when editing through git merge just end with "-e" to show that it is an edit, </p4>
