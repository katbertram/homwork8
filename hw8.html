        1. What is a backend sever? What are three good resources for understanding servers? What do you specifically like about those resources? The backend is how the site is able to do everything the user doesnâ€™t see on their screens, such as updates, security,
        and changes of the webpage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMtgFZSdtwk I like this source because it was a video and therefore their were pictures along with a voice over with simplistic explanations of the fundamentals of servers. http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/54145/i-dont-really-understand-backend-serverside-when-it-comes-to-web-development
        I like this resource because it has multiple users answering questions and therefore you can read through various different explanations to better understand what servers are and how to use them. https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/back-end-web-developer/
        This resource gives a very in depth description along with suggesting other pages with similar topics that could increase your understanding of different severs. 2. What is an SQL versus a noSQL database? Why is one preferred other another? Find
        two good blog entries on how to get started with SQL and tell me what you like about them SQl stands for Structured Query Language and is used to communicate with a database; it is used to preform tasks such as updates and retrieving data from
        the database When doing data scaling SQL is the better way to go, whereas during performance scaling NoSQL is the better sever to use. SQL is usually used by smaller websites where as large scale websites like facebook and Google use NoSQL https://blog.udemy.com/beginners-guide-to-sql/

        a list of at least three sources you consulted in finding that answer http://jamesknelson.com/grokking-es6-promises-the-four-functions-you-need-to-avoid-callback-hell/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
        On these two websites I learned that a promise is a proxy for a value created for use now or in the future, therefore you might not always know the promises value yet. Essentially it promises to eventually give the server something but at the
        moment it is unable to service a request. The promise is either in a state of pending, fulfilled or rejected. http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2015/02/promises/ From this website I learned that promises are a way to work with callbacks and
        serves as a placeholder for the final result. 5. Imagine you are working on a problem with using git to merge files from another contributor on your project. What resources can you find to help you understand git merge? On your system, what editor
        gets launched to show merges? How do you use it to edit text, save, and exit? These a thee unique resources I found to help with git merge problems https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-9NGrpU-c https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge http://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git
